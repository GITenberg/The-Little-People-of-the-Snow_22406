That little brook was fringed with other flowers,&mdash;<br />
White flowers, with crystal leaf and stem, that grew<br />
In clear November nights. And, later still,<br />

My young geographer, for then the Alps,<br />
With their broad pastures, haply were untrod<br />

Had sounded in the woods that overhang<br />
Our Alleghany's streams. I think it was<br />
Upon the slopes of the great Caucasus,<br />
Or where the rivulets of Ararat<br />
Seek the Armenian vales. That mountain rose<br />
So high, that, on its top, the winter snow<br />
Was never melted, and the cottagers<br />
Among the summer blossoms, far below,<br />
Saw its white peaks in August from their door.<br />

Bury the forest floor in heaps of leaves.<br /></div>

And fair, bright locks, and voices like the sound<br />
Of steps on the crisp snow, in which they talked<br />
With man, as friend with friend. A merry sight<br />
It was, when, crowding round the traveller,<br />
They smote him with their heaviest snow-flakes, flung<br />
Needles of frost in handfuls at his cheeks,<br />
And, of the light wreaths of his smoking breath,<br />
Wove a white fringe for his brown beard, and laughed<br />
Their slender laugh to see him wink and grin<br /></div>

Among these Little People of the Snow!<br />
To them the sun's warm beams were shafts of fire,<br />
And the soft south wind was the wind of death.<br />
Away they flew, all with a pretty scowl<br />
Upon their childish faces, to the north,<br />
Or scampered upward to the mountain's top,<br />
And there defied their enemy, the Spring;<br />
Skipping and dancing on the frozen peaks,<br /></div>

But I must speak of graver matters now.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mid-winter was the time, and Eva stood,</span><br />
Within the cottage, all prepared to dare<br />
The outer cold, with ample furry robe<br />
Close belted round her waist, and boots of fur,<br />
And a broad kerchief, which her mother's hand<br />
Had closely drawn about her ruddy cheek.<br /></div><div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class='poem'>"Now, stay not long abroad," said the good dame,<br />
"For sharp is the outer air, and, mark me well,<br />
Go not upon the snow beyond the spot<br />
Where the great linden bounds the neighboring field."<br /><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little maiden promised, and went forth,</span><br />
And climbed the rounded snow-swells firm with frost<br />
Beneath her feet, and slid, with balancing arms,<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>Into the hollows. Once, as up a drift<br />
She slowly rose, before her, in the way,<br />
She saw a little creature lily-cheeked,<br />
With flowing flaxen locks, and faint blue eyes,<br />
That gleamed like ice, and robe that only seemed<br />
Of a more shadowy whiteness than her cheek.<br />
On a smooth bank she sat.<br /></div>

<div class='poem'><span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Alice.</i>&mdash;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;She must have been</span><br />
One of your Little People of the Snow.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Uncle John.</i>&mdash;She was so, and, as Eva now drew near</span><br />
The tiny creature bounded from her seat;<br />
"And come," she said, "my pretty friend; to-day<br />
We will be playmates. I have watched thee long,<br />
And seen how well thou lov'st to walk these drifts,<br />
And scoop their fair sides into little cells,<br />
And carve them with quaint figures, huge-limbed men,<br />
Lions, and griffins. We will have, to-day,<br />
A merry ramble over these bright fields,<br />
And thou shalt see what thou hast never seen."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On went the pair, until they reached the bound</span><br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Where the great linden stood, set deep in snow,<br />
Up to the lower branches. "Here we stop,"<br />
Said Eva, "for my mother has my word<br />
That I will go no further than this tree."<br />
Then the snow-maiden laughed: "And what is this?<br />
This fear of the pure snow, the innocent snow,<br />
That never harmed aught living? Thou mayst roam<br />
For leagues beyond this garden, and return<br />
In safety; here the grim wolf never prowls,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>And here the eagle of our mountain-crags<br />
Preys not in winter. I will show the way<br />
And bring thee safely home. Thy mother, sure,<br />
Counselled thee thus because thou hadst no guide."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By such smooth words was Eva won to break</span><br />
Her promise, and went on with her new friend,<br />
Over the glistening snow and down a bank<br />
Where a white shelf, wrought by the eddying wind,<br />
Like to a billow's crest in the great sea,<br />
Curtained an opening. "Look, we enter here."<br />
And straight, beneath the fair o'erhanging fold,<br />
Entered the little pair that hill of snow,<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>Walking along a passage with white walls,<br />
And a white vault above where snow-stars shed<br />
A wintry twilight. Eva moved in awe,<br />
And held her peace, but the snow-maiden smiled,<br />
And talked and tripped along, as, down the way,<br />
Deeper they went into that mountainous drift.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now the white walls widened, and the vault</span><br />
Swelled upward, like some vast cathedral dome,<br />
Such as the Florentine, who bore the name<br />
Of heaven's most potent angel, reared, long since,<br />
Or the unknown builder of that wondrous fane,<br />
The glory of Burgos. Here a garden lay,<br />
In which the Little People of the Snow<br />
Were wont to take their pastime when their tasks<br />
Upon the mountain's side and in the clouds<br />
Were ended. Here they taught the silent frost<br />
To mock, in stem and spray, and leaf and flower,<br /></div>

Of Lebanon, stretched far their level boughs,<br />
Yet pale and shadowless; the sturdy oak<br />
Stood, with its huge gnarled roots of seeming strength,<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>

Fast anchored, in the glistening bank; light sprays<br />
Of myrtle, roses in their bud and bloom,<br />
Drooped by the winding walks; yet all seemed wrought<br />
Of stainless alabaster; up the trees<br />
Ran the lithe jessamine, with stalk and leaf<br />
Colorless as her flowers. "Go softly on,"<br />
Said the snow-maiden; "touch not, with thy hand,<br />
The frail creation round thee, and beware<br />
To sweep it with thy skirts. Now look above.<br />
How sumptuously these bowers are lighted up<br />
With shifting gleams that softly come and go!<br />
These are the northern lights, such as thou seest<br />
In the midwinter nights, cold, wandering flames,<br />
That float, with our processions, through the air;<br />
And here, within our winter palaces,<br />
Mimic the glorious daybreak." Then she told<br />
How, when the wind, in the long winter nights,<br />
Swept the light snows into the hollow dell,<br />
She and her comrades guided to its place<br />
Each wandering flake, and piled them quaintly up,<br />
In shapely colonnade and glistening arch,<br />
With shadowy aisles between, or bade them grow<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Beneath their little hands, to bowery walks<br />
In gardens such as these, and, o'er them all,<br />
Built the broad roof. "But thou hast yet to see<br />
A fairer sight," she said, and led the way<br />
To where a window of pellucid ice<br />
Stood in the wall of snow, beside their path.<br />
"Look, but thou mayst not enter." Eva looked,<br /></div>

And lo! a glorious hall, from whose high vault<br />
Stripes of soft light, ruddy, and delicate green,<br />
And tender blue, flowed downward to the floor<br />
And far around, as if the aerial hosts,<br />
That march on high by night, with beamy spears,<br />
And streaming banners, to that place had brought<br />
Their radiant flags to grace a festival.<br /></div>

Of those by whom its glistening walls were reared,<br />
Whirled in a merry dance to silvery sounds,<br />
That rang from cymbals of transparent ice,<br />
And ice-cups, quivering to the skilful touch<br />
Of little fingers. Round and round they flew,<br />
As when, in spring, about a chimney-top,<br />
A cloud of twittering swallows, just returned,<br />
Wheel round and round, and turn and wheel again,<br />
Unwinding their swift track. So rapidly<br />
Flowed the meandering stream of that fair dance,<br />
Beneath that dome of light. Bright eyes that looked<br />
From under lily brows, and gauzy scarfs<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
And there stood Eva, wondering at the sight<br />
Of those bright revellers and that graceful sweep<br />
Of motion as they passed her;&mdash;long she gazed,<br />
And listened long to the sweet sounds that thrilled<br />
The frosty air, till now the encroaching cold<br />
Recalled her to herself. "Too long, too long<br />
I linger here," she said, and then she sprang<br />
Into the path, and with a hurried step<br />
Followed it upward. Ever by her side<br />
Her little guide kept pace. As on they went<br />
Eva bemoaned her fault: "What must they think&mdash;<br />
The dear ones in the cottage, while so long,<br />
Hour after hour, I stay without? I know<br />
That they will seek me far and near, and weep<br />
To find me not. How could I, wickedly,<br />
Neglect the charge they gave me?" As she spoke,<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
The hot tears started to her eyes; she knelt<br />
In the mid path. "Father! forgive this sin;<br />
Forgive myself I cannot"&mdash;thus she prayed,<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
And rose and hastened onward. When, at last,<br />
They reached the outer air, the clear north breathed<br />
A bitter cold, from which she shrank with dread,<br />
But the snow-maiden bounded as she felt<br />
The cutting blast, and uttered shouts of joy,<br /></div>

And skipped, with boundless glee, from drift to drift,<br />
And danced round Eva, as she labored up<br />
The mounds of snow, "Ah me! I feel my eyes<br />
Grow heavy," Eva said; "they swim with sleep;<br />
I cannot walk for utter weariness,<br />
And I must rest a moment on this bank,<br />
But let it not be long." As thus she spoke,<br />
In half-formed words, she sank on the smooth snow,<br />
With closing lids. Her guide composed the robe<br />
About her limbs, and said, "A pleasant spot<br /></div>

<div class='poem'>
Is this to slumber in; on such a couch<br />
Oft have I slept away the winter night,<br />
And had the sweetest dreams." So Eva slept,<br />
But slept in death; for when the power of frost<br />
Locks up the motions of the living frame,<br />
The victim passes to the realm of Death<br />
Through the dim porch of Sleep. The little guide,<br />
Watching beside her, saw the hues of life<br />
Fade from the fair smooth brow and rounded cheek,<br />
As fades the crimson from a morning cloud,<br />
Till they were white as marble, and the breath<br />
Had ceased to come and go, yet knew she not<br />
At first that this was death. But when she marked<br />
How deep the paleness was, how motionless<br />
That once lithe form, a fear came over her.<br />
She strove to wake the sleeper, plucked her robe,<br />
And shouted in her ear, but all in vain;<br />
The life had passed away from those young limbs.<br /></div>

Were seeking Eva; from afar they saw<br />
The twain, and hurried toward them. As they came,<br />
With gentle chidings ready on their lips,<br />
And marked that death-like sleep, and heard the tale<br />
Of the snow-maiden, mortal anguish fell<br />
Upon their hearts, and bitter words of grief<br />
And blame were uttered: "Cruel, cruel one,<br />
To tempt our daughter thus, and cruel we,<br />
Who suffered her to wander forth alone<br />
In this fierce cold." They lifted the dear child,<br />
And bore her home and chafed her tender limbs,<br /></div>

To make the chilled blood move, and win the breath<br />

Should look on them. "Why die we not with her?"<br />
They said; "without her life is bitterness."<br /></div>

Of all that pastoral region gathered round,<br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
